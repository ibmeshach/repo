        <h1>WHO IS <strong>THE MECHANIC NEXT DOOR</strong> ?</h1>
         <p>The mechanic next door is a 400lv mechanical engineering student of the university of Benin.<br>She is very focused and determined and has a clear and well defined goal for herself.</p>
         <p>She started her mechanic journey in 2020 during the <strong>COVID 19 PANDEMIC</strong> at a road side mechanic shop in Siluko road, Benin City and this spaned through out the year.</p>
         <p>The pandemic subsided and in 2021, school resumed for her. Thus unfortumately throughout the year 2021, she made no visit to the shop she had now grown to love so much. <br>Although this was the case, she kept herself busy with constantly revising all she had learnt using the notes she made while at work and youtube vidoes as well.</p>
         <p>In 2022, her school - <strong>University of Benin</strong> went on an eight months strike and she definitely took the opportunity to go back to work and beautifully on arrival it seemed like she never left.<br>April 2022, she decided it was time to do more so she applied and got accepted to Intern with <stong>Engine Tech Nigeria Limited</stong> and that was by far one of the best decisions she made because although she had to spend a lot on transportation, the level of organisation, insights and experience was all she needed.</p>
         <p>With all these set in motion for her, she launched <strong>THE MECHANIC NEXT DOOR</strong> where she offered home car maintenace services during the weekends.<br>Now while this was an amazing start up, it also gave little or no time for an active social life, <em><small>did this bother her? yes, would she takes things back? no</small></em></p>
         <p>September 2022, she decided it was time to start another sector of her brand and this one had to involve giving back to society, hence she launched <strong>THE MECHANIC NEXT DOOR ACADENNY</strong>. <br> This initiative was aimed at empowering as many citizens as she could on automobile repairs with hands on training.</p>
